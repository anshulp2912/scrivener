| Notes|Self Assessment  zero (none), one (a litte), two (somewhat), three (a lot)| Evidence|
|-----|--------|---------|
|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|3|evidence  in GH|
| Number of commits|3|in GH|
| Number of commits: by different people|3|in GH|
| Issues reports: there are **many**| | |
|  issues are being  closed| |evidence in GH|
| DOI badge: exists | |in GH|
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly | |in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | | |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| |doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| | |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| | |
| Use of version control tools| | |
|Use of  style checkers | |config files in GH showing your config| 
| Use of code  formatters. | |config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
| Use of syntax checkers| 3 |config files iin  GH showing this checker's config|
| Use of code coverage | |config files in GH|
| other automated analysis tools| |config files in GH|
| test cases exist| |dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base|
| test cases are routinely executed| |e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| | |
| issues are discussed before they are closed| | even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
| Chat channel: exists| | |
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.| |if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| | |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| | |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| | |
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| | |
|short release cycles |  |(hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
