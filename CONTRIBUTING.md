### Reporting Bugs 
This section gives detailed information on how to report bugs. Reporting a bug will help the community and maintainers of the repository. <br>
Before reporting any bug, make sure it is correct and you have all the details with you. Fot creating any bug report, please fill out [the required template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md). This template will give us necessary information to help solve a bug faster.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report
The following is a list of items you need to check before submitting a bug report. <br>

[debugging guide](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/). Check out this debugging guide, which helps you to find the cause of the problem and you may fix it by yourself manually. <br>
[cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom) A cursory search is necessary to check if the reported bug is already mentioned before or not. You can add to the existing bug report if the issue is still open.

#### To Submit A Good Bug Report
[GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) You can track the bugs from this. For the repository that has bug, create an issue and fill out [the template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to give details of the bug.


* To identify the problem, give the issue a clear and informative term. <br>
* Describe in as much detail as possible to duplicate the problem. Explain the problem and explain about the exact command sused in the terminal which caus ethe bug to occur.
* To demonstrate the steps, give specific examples. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* Specify what is the problem beavior and what you expected to see and why
* If possible, include screenshots and animated GIFs that clearly demonstrate the problem. [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)- to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* To include a crash report, add a stack trace from the operating system. For macOS, `Console.app` under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports" has crash report. Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* For performance or memory issues, include a [CPU profile capture](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#diagnose-runtime-performance) with your report.

Provide more context by answering these questions: <br>
* If the problem started happening recently then try downloading the old version of the packages and the code.
* Include details about your configuration and environment.
* What is the name and version of the OS you're using?
* Are you running the project in a virtual environment?
* Which packages have installed in your system? You can get a list of packages installed by running 'apm list --installed'

## Suggesting Enhancements

Any suggesting enhancements like adding new features or imporving existing functionalities, etc can done by following the below guidelines. They help maintainers understand your improvement. <br>
[the template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)- this template is to be filled to add suggestions. These can include the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Start Your Contribution

`beginner` and `help-wanted` issues can help you getting started to contribute your first contribution:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

#### Local development

For developing the project, each section is done locally.
* [Contributing to Calculator](https://github.com/anshulp2912/SE_Fall2021_G13_HW2b/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

#### Pull Requests

The goals to be considered are:
- Focus of problems that are more valuable to users of the platform
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution
- To review contributions, enable a sustainable system for the maintainers

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
2. Verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing  once the pull request is submitted. <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

#### CoffeeScript Styleguide

* Set parameter defaults without spaces around the equal sign

* Use spaces around operators
    * `count + 1` instead of `count+1`
* Use spaces after commas (unless separated by newlines)
* Use parentheses if it improves code clarity.
* Prefer alphabetic keywords to symbolic keywords:
    * `a is b` instead of `a == b`
* Avoid spaces inside the curly-braces of hash literals:
    * `{a: 1, b: 2}` instead of `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`
* Include a single line of whitespace between methods.
* Capitalize initialisms and acronyms in names, except for the first word, which
  should be lower-case:
  * `getURI` instead of `getUri`
  * `uriToOpen` instead of `URIToOpen`
* Use `slice()` to copy an array
* Add an explicit `return` when your function ends with a `for`/`while` loop and
  you don't want it to return a collected array.
* Use `this` instead of a standalone `@`
  * `return this` instead of `return @`
* Place requires in the following order:
    * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
    * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Place class properties in the following order:
    * Class methods and properties (methods starting with a `@`)

    * Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
    * Reference instance methods with `{ClassName::methodName}`
    * Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`
